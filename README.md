# Project 02: Multi-source code search

### About the Project

This project has the goal of developing a search engine able to query a large Python code repository using multiple sources of information. 
It is part of the Knowledge Analysis & Management - 2022 course from the Universit√† della Svizzera italiana.

In this repository, you can find the following files:
- tensor flow: a code repository to be used during this project
- ground-truth-unique: a file containing the references triples necessary to evaluate the search engine (step 3) 

For more information, see the Project-02 slides (available on iCourse)

Note: Feel free to modify this file according to the project's necessities.
